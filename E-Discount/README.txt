 =========== MVC Architecture ==============
 1. controllers: used to handle the user authendication and access the database
 2. node-modules: autogenerated files used by node for all the dependencies used in the project
 3. public: includes all the static files. That can be images, css, javascript etc
 4. routes: express.js files to handle the pages and routes included in the project and will be used in the server
 5. views: this is for all our template engines: all the html code. The files are of .hbs type which stands for handlebars, and its a templating method for html. Disclaimer: these kind of files can read normal html!
 6. .env: This file includes all the sensitive information of the environment, like passwords for the connection with the database, port number etc.
 7. app.js: the main http server creation file with express.js
 8. pachage-lock.json: autogenerated json file that we DO NOT touch
 9. package.json: autogenerated json file neccessary for npm which handles all the commands of npm. E.g.: to run the server we type npm start because in the package.json file we specify that "start" == "node app.js" which is the file that includes the server acceleration, and this is the command to run a file in node.js
10. README.txt: This file will include the descriptions of all the files in this project
